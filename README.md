# Barista-App

Author: Matt Anthony

This is a Barista Application project created using the react.js framework. The user refreshes the page, getting a random drink name from a downloaded json file. 
The user then has to select the correct ingredients and method of preperation in 4 categories: temperature, syrup, milk type, and belended.
The user then checks their answers and sees what they got correct (green) and what they got wrong (red).

Test your barista knowledge!
